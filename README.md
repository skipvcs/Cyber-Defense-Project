# Cyber-Defense-Project
Building a strong foundation of defensive information security skills

<h2>Description</h2>

This Project includes the following tasks:

1.    Analyze a remote intrusion attempt:
A security operations center analyst has seen evidence of a password cracking attempt within a key network. I analyzed a packet capture file and event logs within a security information and event management system (the Splunk SIEM) to determine if any passwords were compromised and if the network was breached as a result. 
 
2.    Investigate an incident using a SIEM:
Analyzed a possible “watering hole” attack in which clicking on a malicious link embedded in an otherwise legitimate website launches an exploit kit that infects a user’s machine with a “banking trojan.” 

3.    Compile indicators of compromise to guide forensic analysis:
Use a “hash” of a possible malware-containing file to conduct research using VirusTotal, online sandboxes, and open-source intelligence sources to determine specific indicators of compromise to guide forensic analysis of memory and file system images of infected devices.

4.    Examine a compromised host’s memory:
Perform a forensic examination of a memory image taken from a computer to identify sophisticated malware that infected the system.
 
5.    Conduct a forensic disk examination: 
Perform disk forensics on an infected system. By analyzing an image of the computer’s file system, and was are able to identify malware infections and to create a timeline for the attack.

6.    Close the investigation:
Conclude the investigation by compiling a timeline for the attack and writing a comprehensive report for technical and non-technical stakeholders.
